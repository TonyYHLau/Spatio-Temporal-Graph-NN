My paper is about spatio-temporal graph neural networks. "Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Forecasting: Spatial Layers First or Temporal Layers First?" Details can be found on the pdf file.
A short paper version has been published on ACM SIGSPATIAL 21. https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3474717.3484207
